<!--
webpack and babel are resonsible
of running our react code
on the browser.
-->

<!--
make sure you install the dependencies in this folder with
npm install
then run the server with
npm start
make sure the server is still running when you work on the project.

the bundle.js file
is the compiled javascript for the entire application.
all of the js files in the src folder are put togther
into a single file, our bundle.js
the webpack and babel are responsible for doing that.

in localhost:8080
we see this file html on the screen.

everything we add in the body tags will be shown on the screen
once we refresh the screen.

we want start fresh so delete the src folder
so we can recreate it from scratch.
